- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @guifranchi
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in everyhting that is related to technology. But I am also a commercial pilot, so I LOVE TO FLY, and spend most of my weekends "in the air". I always try to learn new things and I am passionate about new technologies. Ah, I do also like to share my knowledge with as much people as possible. So, this is why I decided to create this repo, so I can share a little bit of what I know and I hope that I can help with new technologies and new trends in the future!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning new things about GIT, Machine Learning and Cloud. I really would like to be able to bring new stuff into the aviation area. And looking forward to meet you that have the same desired, so we can make a lot of things, and better!
